[Webpacker] Compiling...
[Webpacker] Compiled all packs in /Users/haizhou/Desktop/capstone-git/Stock-Byte-App/public/packs
[Webpacker] One CLI for webpack must be installed. These are recommended choices, delivered as separate packages:
 - webpack-cli (https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli)
   The original webpack full-featured CLI.
We will use "npm" to install the CLI via "npm install -D".
Do you want to install 'webpack-cli' (yes/no):

[Webpacker] Compiled all packs in /Users/haizhou/Desktop/capstone-git/Stock-Byte-App/public/packs
[Webpacker] One CLI for webpack must be installed. These are recommended choices, delivered as separate packages:
 - webpack-cli (https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli)
   The original webpack full-featured CLI.
We will use "yarn" to install the CLI via "yarn add -D".
Do you want to install 'webpack-cli' (yes/no):
